# Leadscore
### Project Overview
This project involves building a logistic regression model to predict lead conversion for X Education, an online course provider. The goal is to assign a lead score to each potential lead, helping the company focus on high-potential leads to improve their lead conversion rate from the current 30% to a target of 80%.

### Problem Statement
X Education acquires leads through various sources, but only a small fraction convert into paying customers. The company needs to identify which leads are most likely to convert, allowing the sales team to prioritize and target these 'Hot Leads' effectively. The challenge is to create a model that scores leads based on their likelihood of conversion.

### Data Description
The dataset provided includes around 9000 data points with attributes such as Lead Source, Total Time Spent on Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity. The target variable is 'Converted', indicating whether a lead was converted (1) or not (0). Categorical variables with levels like 'Select' are treated as null values and need appropriate handling.

### Goals
1)Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each lead.
2)Address additional problems presented by the company, adjusting the model as required.
3)Deliver the results in a Jupyter notebook with detailed comments, a word document answering specific questions, a concise presentation, and a summary report.

### Contents
1)Jupyter Notebook: Includes the logistic regression model, predictions, and evaluation metrics, with comprehensive comments.
2)Word Document: Solutions to all the company's questions based on the logistic regression model.
3)Presentation (PDF): A concise, clear presentation for the chief data scientist, covering both technical and business aspects, including visualizations and key results.
4)Summary Report (PDF): A 500-word summary explaining the approach, analysis, results, and learnings from the assignment.

### Tools and Technologies Used

Power Point

### Summary
By developing this predictive model, X Education can enhance its sales strategy, focusing efforts on high-potential leads and ultimately increasing the lead conversion rate. The project will involve data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and effective communication of results.
